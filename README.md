## ðŸ“‹ About App

Listen to Great Music!

This app was developed during my learning of Vue.js, which has been an awesome journey so far! With it, you can upload, manage and listen to your favorite songs. You can also create your account and leave a comment of how thrilling was to listen to that song!
